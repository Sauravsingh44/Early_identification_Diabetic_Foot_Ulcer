# Early Detection of Diabetic Foot Ulcers using Temperature Asymmetry

This project presents a novel, cost-effective machine learning workflow for the early prediction of Diabetic Foot Ulcers (DFUs). Instead of relying on expensive and complex thermal imaging, this approach leverages simple, sensor-based numerical temperature data. [cite_start]The core of the methodology is the analysis of **temperature asymmetry** between corresponding regions of the left and right feet, which serves as a powerful physiological indicator for inflammation and potential ulceration[cite: 443, 476].

1.  **Data Preprocessing & Feature Engineering:**
    * [cite_start]The core feature, **temperature asymmetry ($\Delta T_i$)**, was calculated as the absolute difference between the mean temperatures of the left and right foot for each of the 8 regions[cite: 332, 333].
    * [cite_start]From this, additional powerful features were engineered: `max_temp`, `min_temp`, and `temp_range` to capture localized inflammation and overall thermal imbalance[cite: 337, 341].
    * [cite_start]A target label was created based on clinical studies, classifying a patient as at risk for an ulcer if the `temp_range` across foot regions exceeds a **3â„ƒ threshold**[cite: 351, 352].
